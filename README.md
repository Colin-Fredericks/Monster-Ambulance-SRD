# Monster-Ambulance-SRD

Monster Ambulance is a tabletop roleplaying game by Colin Fredericks. This is the System Reference Document - it gives you the rules you need to play the game, without any of the nice art and layout.

The SRD and all documents in this repository are licensed CC-0 1.0, which places it into the public domain. You can use it for anything you want, including commercial purposes. You can make changes, you can split it up, you can change terminology, it's yours.

I would appreciate if you included something like "Rules based on Monster Ambulance by Colin Fredericks" - but you don't have to, and you can alter the text if you want.

You can say things like "Compatible with Monster Ambulance" if you want.
