# Monster Ambulance

Monster Ambulance is a traditional-style roleplaying game, with one Game Master (GM) and about 4 players. Each player has one character. If there's a 5th (or 6th?!) player, they get to play the Horde, which we'll talk about later.

If you've never played a roleplaying game before, you might want to check out some “actual play” videos online. There are a lot of great examples that show how people play tabletop RPGs. Don’t feel like you need to be as polished and professional as an online Game Master, though. Just take a look and get a feel for how the GM and players interact.

All set? Let's go.

Characters are defined by **Hallmarks** (what kind of person you are), **Callings** (why you got into this profession), **Careers** (your job), and **Relationships** (your connection to your friends in the hospital). Each of these is rated from d4 (counterproductive) through d6, d8, and d10 (increasing levels of usefulness), maxing out at d12 (amazing). Characters also have **Situations** they're trying to fix.

When you act in this game, you make a **Dice Pool** out of those, rolling several dice at once, and use your **Knacks** (unique skills and perks) to improve the results. The GM uses the **Emergency** dice pool for action scenes, and a **Situation** dice pool for chatting scenes. One player rolls, the GM rolls, and the higher roll wins. Sometimes you'll gain **Plot Points**, which you can use to power Knacks and do other cool stuff. On the other hand, sometimes you'll roll a **Snag**, which lets the GM do cool stuff\* with the Emergency dice. When you win, you reduce the Emergency or Situation dice pool. When you lose either they increase or you end up with additional **Stress**. Either way, the action moves forward – there are no "hard stop" moments.

The game alternates back and forth between **action** scenes (which happen in the ambulance and involve **patients**), and a series of social scenes (which happen in the hospital and involve **NPCs**). There will be enough chatting scenes to give everyone the opportunity to work on their Situations, and maybe even resolve one of them, but you won't resolve everything before the next call comes in and you're back out on the road. Each game session is an **episode**, which is normally one **shift** (a single night at work). Longer game sessions might cover multiple days and you might have more than one shift.

\* For values of "cool" that your character would definitely consider uncool
